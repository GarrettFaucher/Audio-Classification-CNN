# Audio-Classification-CNN
As a final project for the CS 254: Machine Learning course at the University of Vermont, we worked with classifying audio files based on gender and emotion.

# Personal Contribution To Final Project
* Built all aspects of convolutional neural nework
  * Architecture of CNN
  * Hyperparameter tuning using KerasTuner
* Preproccessed audio WAV files to be uniform length with little silent time
* Proccessed WAV files into Mel-frequency cepstrum (MFCC) data for ML algorithims
